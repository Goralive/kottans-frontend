## Git Basics
This knowledge I will use in daily practice. I have discovered some new knowledge that I didn't knew, like cherry-pick and rebase

## Linux CLI, and HTTP
I have finished the course on CLI. It was interesitng for me and now I'm trying to use in each case as I can. Some of the commands I knew, but forget. It's preety good expirience. Always forget touch command ^_^
