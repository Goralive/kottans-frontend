# General basics

This knowledge I will use in daily practice wtih git. Understand how can I create a branch and view a history about commits

I have finished the course on CLI. It was interesitng for me and now I'm trying to use in each case as I can. Some of the commands I knew, but forget. It's preety good expirience. Always forget touch command ^\_^

## 2.Git Collaboration

I have finished git Collaboration and feel with git preety confident. But should be more practice! I have discovered some new knowledge that I didn't knew, like cherry-pick and rebase

# Front-End Basics

## 3.Intro to HTML & CSS

For me this is first expirience for create html pages and it's preety awesome to she the results of your work so fast!
Marvelous expirience! Have never create grid, so for me this need more practice and work with css styles.

## 4.Responsive Web Design

Preety hard for me was the responsive wed design section. In the future I will get more courses about this theme because I want to have a responsive sites.
But the main idea that I get is you need to be an artist and make beatuful, great UX for the users.
